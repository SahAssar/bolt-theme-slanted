# These are the images that are shown on the frontpage slider and when a page
# does not have its own images to show. These are either images in your 'files'
# folder like '2016-06/img-1668.jpg' or like the defaults, in your 'theme' folder
# like below. use paths that are relative to either 'files' or 'theme'. If you
# have copied/renamed the theme to another folder to modify it you probably want
# to replace 'slanted' with your theme name.
